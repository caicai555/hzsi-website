I am Haozhong Si, a passionate researcher who recently completed MSc in [Lab of Animal Behavior & Conservation](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Li-Lab-on-ANIMAL-BEHAVIOR-CONSERVATION-Zhongqiu-Li) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/). My research interest spans several areas, with a particular focus on **Conservation Culturomics, iEcology**, and **Animal Behavior**. I am especially interested in exploring the **human dimensions of biodiversity conservation**, including how digital data can inform conservation priorities and strategies.

My MSc thesis, supervised by [Prof. Zhongqiu Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhongqiu-Li-3), investigated the production and consumption of online animal content, focusing on patterns and trends of human-animal interaction in digital spaces. Using video content as a case study, I analyzed viewer perspectives through word frequency analysis, semantic analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling of video comments. I also applied network analysis to video tags to uncover trends in content creation from the perspective of video creators. This research offered valuable insights into how humans engage with animal content online, highlighting implications for enhancing management and strategies for biodiversity conservation in the digital age.
